**rjuliabugs** is an R package that provides a bridge between R and [JuliaBUGS](https://turing.ml/dev/), the BUGS-style Bayesian modeling interface developed in Julia as part of the [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/dev/) probabilistic programming ecosystem.

**JuliaBUGS** allows users to define models using the familiar BUGS syntax while leveraging the speed and flexibility of the Julia language. It enables automatic translation of BUGS code into modern probabilistic programs that run efficiently with advanced inference engines such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), Variational Inference, and particle methods — all accessible via Turing.jl.

With `rjuliabugs`, R users can run BUGS models/code through JuliaBUGS and take advantage of the inference algorithms available in Turing.jl, without leaving the R environment. This not only provides a seamless path to adopt faster and more flexible sampling methods but also allows integration with R’s extensive post-processing ecosystem (e.g., `bayesplot`, `posterior`, `coda`). It lowers the barrier for existing BUGS users to adopt modern Bayesian tools without abandoning their existing model codebase.


## Installation

You can install the development version of **rjuliabugs** from [GitHub](https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs")
```

## Troubleshooting and `JuliaCall` Setup

The `rjuliabugs` package relies heavily on the [`JuliaCall`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall) package, which can occasionally cause issues if it is not installed or configured correctly.

Many of the most common installation problems related to `JuliaCall` are well documented in the [Troubleshooting and Ways to Get 
Help](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall#troubleshooting-and-ways-to-get-help) section of the `JuliaCall` GitHub page.

If you encounter any issues while setting up `rjuliabugs` on your system that are not covered there, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs/issues) on this repository. We're happy to help!
