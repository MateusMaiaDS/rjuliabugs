**rjuliabugs** is an R package that provides a bridge between R and [JuliaBUGS](https://github.com/TuringLang/JuliaBUGS.jl?tab=readme-ov-file), the [BUGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinBUGS)-style Bayesian modeling interface developed in Julia as part of the [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/dev/) probabilistic programming ecosystem.

**JuliaBUGS** allows users to define models using the familiar BUGS syntax while leveraging the speed and flexibility of the Julia language. It enables automatic translation of BUGS code into modern probabilistic programs that run efficiently with advanced inference engines such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), Variational Inference, and particle methods — all accessible via Turing.jl.

With `rjuliabugs`, R users can run BUGS models/code through JuliaBUGS and take advantage of the inference algorithms available in Turing.jl, without leaving the R environment. This not only provides a seamless path to adopt faster (including [parallelization](#using-rjuliabugs-in-parallel)) and more flexible sampling methods but also allows integration with R’s extensive post-processing ecosystem (e.g., `bayesplot`, `posterior`, `coda`). It lowers the barrier for existing BUGS users to adopt modern Bayesian tools without abandoning their existing model codebase.

## Installing `Julia`

We recommend installing Julia using [`juliaup`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), the **official Julia version manager**. It provides a reliable and maintainable way to install, update, and manage Julia versions across platforms.

Using `juliaup` is preferred over downloading Julia manually because:
- It makes upgrading Julia seamless and safe.
- It supports managing multiple versions.
- It ensures compatibility with R-Julia integration tools like `JuliaCall`.

### Windows (via PowerShell)

Open PowerShell (as Administrator) and run:

```powershell
winget install --id=JuliaLang.Julia -e
```

> Requires Windows 10/11 with [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) available.

### macOS (via Homebrew)

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), run:

```sh
brew install juliaup
juliaup add release
```

This installs `juliaup` and sets the latest stable Julia version as default.

### Ubuntu (via APT)

On recent Ubuntu versions, you can install via APT:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install juliaup
juliaup add release
```

If `juliaup` is not available via APT on your system, follow manual installation instructions at the [Juliaup GitHub page](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#installation).

#### Verify Installation

After installation, open a terminal and run:

```sh
julia
```

This should start the Julia REPL with the installed version. You are now ready to use Julia with `rjuliabugs`.


## Troubleshooting `JuliaCall` setup

The `rjuliabugs` package relies on the [`JuliaCall`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall) package to communicate with Julia from R. Errors may occur if Julia is not properly installed or if `JuliaCall` cannot locate the Julia binary. The most common errors include:


### Error type: "`Julia` Not Found"

The `JULIA_HOME` environment variable tells R where to find Julia. If it's not set correctly, `rjuliabugs` will not be able to communicate with Julia via `JuliaCall`.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
2. Check if `JULIA_HOME` is set by running:

```
echo $JULIA_HOME
```

> (On Windows PowerShell use: `echo $Env:JULIA_HOME`)

3. If empty or incorrect, and you installed Julia using `juliaup`, the Julia binary is typically located at:

```
~/.juliaup/bin
```

You can set the environment variable for the current session with:

```
export JULIA_HOME="$HOME/.juliaup/bin"
```

>(On Windows PowerShell use: `$Env:JULIA_HOME="$HOME/.juliaup/bin`")

Replace the path with the correct location if your installation differs (e.g., if you're on Windows, it might be something like `"C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Local/Programs/Julia-1.x.x/bin"`).

4. **To make this setting permanent (so you don't need to set it every time):**

   - **On macOS/Linux:**  
     Open your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) with a text editor:  
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
     or 
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc  
     ```
     Add the following line at the end of the file:  
     ```bash
     export JULIA_HOME="$HOME/.juliaup/bin"  
     ```  
     Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).  
     Then reload your shell configuration or restart your terminal:  
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     *(or `source ~/.zshrc` if using zsh)*

   - **On Windows:**  
     1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and open "Edit the system environment variables."  
     2. Click "Environment Variables."  
     3. Under "User variables" or "System variables," click "New..."  
     4. Set the variable name as `JULIA_HOME` and the value as the path to Julia's binary installed by juliaup (e.g., `C:\Users\your_user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps`).  
     5. Click OK to save all dialogs.  
     6. Restart your terminal or R session for changes to take effect.

5. Verify it is set correctly by re-running:

```bash
echo $JULIA_HOME  
```
> (or in R use: `Sys.getenv("JULIA_HOME")`)

Setting `JULIA_HOME` correctly ensures that `JuliaCall` can launch Julia, which is required for `rjuliabugs` to function.


### Error type: "`R_HOME` not found"

To ensure `rjuliabugs` works correctly, set the `R_HOME` environment variable so Julia can locate your R installation.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Check if `R_HOME` is set by running:

```bash
echo $R_HOME
```

(on Windows PowerShell use `echo $Env:R_HOME`)

3. If empty, open R and run:
```r
R.home()
```

4. Copy the printed R installation path.
5. Set the environment variable in your terminal session with:

```
export R_HOME="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"
```
(On Windows PowerShell, use: `$Env:R_HOME="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"`)

6. **To make this setting permanent (applies every time you open a terminal or run R):**

   - **On macOS/Linux:**  
     Open your shell configuration file with a text editor (e.g., nano):  
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     or if you use zsh:  
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```  
     Add the line:  
     ```bash
     export R_HOME="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"
     ```  
     Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).  
     Then reload your shell configuration or restart your terminal:  
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     *(or `source ~/.zshrc` if using zsh)*

   - **On Windows:**  
     1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and open "Edit the system environment variables."  
     2. Click "Environment Variables."  
     3. Under "User variables" or "System variables," click "New..."  
     4. Set the variable name as `R_HOME` and the value as the full R path you copied.  
     5. Click OK to save all dialogs.  
     6. Restart your terminal or R session for changes to take effect.


7. Verify by reopening the terminal and running the echo command from step 2.

This ensures Julia, when called from R via JuliaCall, can find your R installation and prevents initialization errors in `rjuliabugs`.


### Other installations issues

Many of the most common installation problems related to `JuliaCall` are well documented in the [Troubleshooting and Ways to Get 
Help](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall#troubleshooting-and-ways-to-get-help) section of the `JuliaCall` GitHub page.

If you encounter any issues while setting up `rjuliabugs` on your system that are not covered there, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs/issues) on this repository. We're happy to help!

## Using `rjuliabugs` in parallel

The `JuliaBUGS` library in Julia supports parallel sampling through `AbstractMCMC`. While in a native Julia session this can be easily enabled by launching Julia with the `-t <n_threads>` flag, using multithreaded sampling via `rjuliabugs` requires additional setup. Specifically, you must define the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=n_threads`, where `n_threads` is the number of threads (or CPU cores) you wish to use for parallel computation. This ensures that `rjuliabugs` can properly initialize Julia with multithreading support when running multiple chains in parallel from within an R session. The instructions on how to configure `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` and enable multithreading in your environment, are the following: 

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
2. Check what is set as `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` is set by running:

```bash
echo $JULIA_NUM_THREADS
```

>(On Windows PowerShell use: `echo $Env:JULIA_NUM_THREADS`)

3. If empty or incorrectly set, decide how many threads you want Julia to use (e.g., 4), then set the environment variable in your terminal session:

```bash
export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4
```

> (On Windows PowerShell use: `$Env:JULIA_NUM_THREADS="4"`)

4. **To make this setting permanent (applies every time you open R and Julia):**

   - **On macOS/Linux:**  
     Open your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) with a text editor:  
     
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
     or 
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc  
     ```
     Add the following line at the end of the file:  
     ```bash
     export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4  
     ```
     Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).  
     Then reload your shell configuration or restart your terminal:  
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     *(or `source ~/.zshrc` if using zsh)*

   - **On Windows:**  
     1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and open "Edit the system environment variables."  
     2. Click "Environment Variables."  
     3. Under "User variables" or "System variables," click "New..."  
     4. Set the variable name as `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` and the value as the number of threads (e.g., `4`).  
     5. Click OK to save all dialogs.  
     6. Restart your terminal or R session for changes to take effect.

5. Verify it is set correctly by re-running:

```bash
echo $JULIA_NUM_THREADS  
```
> (or in R use: `Sys.getenv("JULIA_NUM_THREADS")`)

Setting `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` ensures Julia can execute in parallel where possible when running models through `rjuliabugs`.
