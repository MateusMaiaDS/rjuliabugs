**rjuliabugs** is an R package that provides a bridge between R and [JuliaBUGS](https://turing.ml/dev/), the BUGS-style Bayesian modeling interface developed in Julia as part of the [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/dev/) probabilistic programming ecosystem.

This interface enables R users to access and run JuliaBUGS models from within R, leveraging modern Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Automatic Differentiation (AD) while maintaining compatibility with Râ€™s robust ecosystem for diagnostics and visualization.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **rjuliabugs** from [GitHub](https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs")
```

## Troubleshooting and `JuliaCall` Setup

The `rjuliabugs` package relies heavily on the [`JuliaCall`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall) package, which can occasionally cause issues if it is not installed or configured correctly.

Many of the most common installation problems related to `JuliaCall` are well documented in the [Troubleshooting and Ways to Get 
Help](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall#troubleshooting-and-ways-to-get-help) section of the `JuliaCall` GitHub page.

If you encounter any issues while setting up `rjuliabugs` on your system that are not covered there, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs/issues) on this repository. We're happy to help!
