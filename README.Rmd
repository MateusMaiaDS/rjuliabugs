**rjuliabugs** is an R package that provides a bridge between R and [JuliaBUGS](https://turing.ml/dev/), the BUGS-style Bayesian modeling interface developed in Julia as part of the [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/dev/) probabilistic programming ecosystem.

**JuliaBUGS** allows users to define models using the familiar BUGS syntax while leveraging the speed and flexibility of the Julia language. It enables automatic translation of BUGS code into modern probabilistic programs that run efficiently with advanced inference engines such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), Variational Inference, and particle methods — all accessible via Turing.jl.

With `rjuliabugs`, R users can run BUGS models/code through JuliaBUGS and take advantage of the inference algorithms available in Turing.jl, without leaving the R environment. This not only provides a seamless path to adopt faster and more flexible sampling methods but also allows integration with R’s extensive post-processing ecosystem (e.g., `bayesplot`, `posterior`, `coda`). It lowers the barrier for existing BUGS users to adopt modern Bayesian tools without abandoning their existing model codebase.


## Installation

You can install the development version of **rjuliabugs** from [GitHub](https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs")
```

## Installing `Julia`

We recommend installing Julia using [`juliaup`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), the **official Julia version manager**. It provides a reliable and maintainable way to install, update, and manage Julia versions across platforms.

Using `juliaup` is preferred over downloading Julia manually because:
- It makes upgrading Julia seamless and safe.
- It supports managing multiple versions.
- It ensures compatibility with R-Julia integration tools like `JuliaCall`.

### Windows (via PowerShell)

Open PowerShell (as Administrator) and run:

```powershell
winget install --id=JuliaLang.Julia -e
```

> Requires Windows 10/11 with [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) available.

### macOS (via Homebrew)

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), run:

```sh
brew install juliaup
juliaup add release
```

This installs `juliaup` and sets the latest stable Julia version as default.

### Ubuntu (via APT)

On recent Ubuntu versions, you can install via APT:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install juliaup
juliaup add release
```

If `juliaup` is not available via APT on your system, follow manual installation instructions at the [Juliaup GitHub page](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#installation).

#### Verify Installation

After installation, open a terminal and run:

```sh
julia
```

This should start the Julia REPL with the installed version. You are now ready to use Julia with `rjuliabugs`.


## Troubleshooting and `JuliaCall` Setup

The `rjuliabugs` package relies on the [`JuliaCall`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall) package to communicate with Julia from R. Errors may occur if Julia is not properly installed or if `JuliaCall` cannot locate the Julia binary.

### Defining the Julia Path

After confirming that Julia is installed and accessible from your terminal, you must ensure that R can also find the Julia binary.

To check whether `JuliaCall` can detect Julia, run the following in your R console:

```r
Sys.getenv("JULIA_HOME")
```

If this returns an empty string (`""`), it means that `JuliaCall` cannot find Julia on your system's `PATH`. You will need to manually set the path to the Julia binary.

If you installed Julia using `juliaup`, the binary is typically located in:

```
~/.juliaup/bin
```

To make this available to your R session, run:

```r
Sys.setenv(JULIA_HOME = "~/.juliaup/bin")
```

Replace the path with the correct location if your installation differs (e.g., if you're on Windows, it might be something like `"C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Local/Programs/Julia-1.x.x/bin"`).

Once this is set, try initializing Julia in R:

```r
library(JuliaCall)
julia_setup()
```

If successful, you’re ready to use `rjuliabugs`.

> Tip: You can add the `Sys.setenv()` command to your `.Rprofile` file to make the configuration persistent across R sessions.

## Making the change persistent (macOS and Ubuntu)

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable permanently by editing your R environment file `.Renviron`. From the terminal, open the file with a text editor such as nano:

```sh
nano ~/.Renviron
```

Add the following line to the file:

```
JULIA_HOME=~/.juliaup/bin
```

Save and exit. This will ensure that JULIA_HOME is set automatically every time you start R.

After this, verify in an R session:

```r
Sys.getenv("JULIA_HOME")
```

### Setting R_HOME for rjuliabugs (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu)

To ensure rjuliabugs works correctly, set the `R_HOME` environment variable so Julia can locate your R installation.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Check if `R_HOME` is set by running:

```bash
echo $R_HOME
```

(on Windows PowerShell use `echo $Env:R_HOME`)

3. If empty, open R and run:
```r
R.home()
```

4. Copy the printed R installation path.
5. Set the environment variable in your terminal session with:

```
export R_HOME="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"
```
(On Windows PowerShell, use: `$Env:R_HOME="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"`)

6. **To make this setting permanent (applies every time you open a terminal or run R):**

   - **On macOS/Linux:**  
     Open your shell configuration file with a text editor (e.g., nano):  
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     or if you use zsh:  
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```  
     Add the line:  
     ```bash
     export R_HOME="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"
     ```  
     Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).  
     Then reload your shell configuration or restart your terminal:  
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     *(or `source ~/.zshrc` if using zsh)*

   - **On Windows:**  
     1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and open "Edit the system environment variables."  
     2. Click "Environment Variables."  
     3. Under "User variables" or "System variables," click "New..."  
     4. Set the variable name as `R_HOME` and the value as the full R path you copied.  
     5. Click OK to save all dialogs.  
     6. Restart your terminal or R session for changes to take effect.


7. Verify by reopening the terminal and running the echo command from step 2.

This ensures Julia, when called from R via JuliaCall, can find your R installation and prevents initialization errors in rjuliabugs.


### Other installations issues

Many of the most common installation problems related to `JuliaCall` are well documented in the [Troubleshooting and Ways to Get 
Help](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall#troubleshooting-and-ways-to-get-help) section of the `JuliaCall` GitHub page.
