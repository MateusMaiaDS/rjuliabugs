# rjuliabugs

**rjuliabugs** is an R package that provides a bridge between R and
[JuliaBUGS](https://turing.ml/dev/), the BUGS-style Bayesian modeling
interface developed in Julia as part of the
[Turing.jl](https://turing.ml/dev/) probabilistic programming ecosystem.

This interface enables R users to access and run JuliaBUGS models from
within R, leveraging modern Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and Automatic Differentiation (AD) while maintaining
compatibility with Râ€™s robust ecosystem for diagnostics and
visualization.

## Installation
