This section show how to install Julia and setup your R enviroment to use `rjuliabugs` package. See the [article](https://turinglang.org/JuliaBUGS.jl/stable/example/).

## Installing `Julia`

We recommend installing Julia using [`juliaup`](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), the **official Julia version manager**. It provides a reliable and maintainable way to install, update, and manage Julia versions across platforms. Using `juliaup` is preferred over downloading Julia manually because it makes upgrading Julia seamless and safe, supports managing multiple versions, and ensures compatibility with R-Julia integration tools like `JuliaCall`. To install, follow the instructions:


### Windows (via PowerShell)

Open PowerShell (as Administrator) and run:

```powershell
winget install --id=JuliaLang.Julia -e
```

> Requires Windows 10/11 with [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) available.

### macOS (via Homebrew)

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), run:

```sh
brew install juliaup
juliaup add release
```

This installs `juliaup` and sets the latest stable Julia version as default.

### Ubuntu (via APT)

On recent Ubuntu versions, you can install via APT:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install juliaup
juliaup add release
```

If `juliaup` is not available via APT on your system, follow manual installation instructions at the [Juliaup GitHub page](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#installation).

#### Verify Installation

After installation, open a terminal and run:

```sh
julia
```

This should start the Julia REPL with the installed version. You are now ready to use Julia with `rjuliabugs`.


## Troubleshooting `JuliaCall` setup

The `rjuliabugs` package relies on the [`JuliaCall`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall) package to communicate with Julia from R. Errors may occur if Julia is not properly installed or if `JuliaCall` cannot locate the Julia binary. The most common errors include:


### Error type: "`Julia` Not Found"

The `JULIA_HOME` environment variable tells R where to find Julia. If it's not set correctly, `rjuliabugs` will not be able to communicate with Julia via `JuliaCall`.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
2. Check if `JULIA_HOME` is set by running:

```
echo $JULIA_HOME
```

> (On Windows PowerShell use: `echo $Env:JULIA_HOME`)

3. If empty or incorrect, and you installed Julia using `juliaup`, the Julia binary is typically located at:

```
~/.juliaup/bin
```

You can set the environment variable for the current session with:

```
export JULIA_HOME="$HOME/.juliaup/bin"
```

>(On Windows PowerShell use: `$Env:JULIA_HOME="$HOME/.juliaup/bin`")

Replace the path with the correct location if your installation differs (e.g., if you're on Windows, it might be something like `"C:/Users/YourName/AppData/Local/Programs/Julia-1.x.x/bin"`).

4. **To make this setting permanent (so you don't need to set it every time):**

   - **On macOS/Linux:**  
     Open your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) with a text editor:  
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
     or 
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc  
     ```
     Add the following line at the end of the file:  
     ```bash
     export JULIA_HOME="$HOME/.juliaup/bin"  
     ```  
     Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).  
     Then reload your shell configuration or restart your terminal:  
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     *(or `source ~/.zshrc` if using zsh)*

   - **On Windows:**  
     1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and open "Edit the system environment variables."  
     2. Click "Environment Variables."  
     3. Under "User variables" or "System variables," click "New..."  
     4. Set the variable name as `JULIA_HOME` and the value as the path to Julia's binary installed by juliaup (e.g., `C:\Users\your_user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps`).  
     5. Click OK to save all dialogs.  
     6. Restart your terminal or R session for changes to take effect.

5. Verify it is set correctly by re-running:

```bash
echo $JULIA_HOME  
```
> (or in R use: `Sys.getenv("JULIA_HOME")`)

Setting `JULIA_HOME` correctly ensures that `JuliaCall` can launch Julia, which is required for `rjuliabugs` to function.


### Error type: "`R_HOME` not found"

To ensure `rjuliabugs` works correctly, set the `R_HOME` environment variable so Julia can locate your R installation.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Check if `R_HOME` is set by running:

```bash
echo $R_HOME
```

(on Windows PowerShell use `echo $Env:R_HOME`)

3. If empty, open R and run:
```r
R.home()
```

4. Copy the printed R installation path.
5. Set the environment variable in your terminal session with:

```
export R_HOME="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"
```
(On Windows PowerShell, use: `$Env:R_HOME="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"`)

6. **To make this setting permanent (applies every time you open a terminal or run R):**

   - **On macOS/Linux:**  
     Open your shell configuration file with a text editor (e.g., nano):  
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     or if you use zsh:  
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```  
     Add the line:  
     ```bash
     export R_HOME="PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"
     ```  
     Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).  
     Then reload your shell configuration or restart your terminal:  
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     *(or `source ~/.zshrc` if using zsh)*

   - **On Windows:**  
     1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and open "Edit the system environment variables."  
     2. Click "Environment Variables."  
     3. Under "User variables" or "System variables," click "New..."  
     4. Set the variable name as `R_HOME` and the value as the full R path you copied.  
     5. Click OK to save all dialogs.  
     6. Restart your terminal or R session for changes to take effect.


7. Verify by reopening the terminal and running the echo command from step 2.

This ensures Julia, when called from R via JuliaCall, can find your R installation and prevents initialization errors in `rjuliabugs`.


### Other installations issues

Many of the most common installation problems related to `JuliaCall` are well documented in the [Troubleshooting and Ways to Get 
Help](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/JuliaCall#troubleshooting-and-ways-to-get-help) section of the `JuliaCall` GitHub page.

If you encounter any issues while setting up `rjuliabugs` on your system that are not covered there, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/rjuliabugs/issues) on this repository. We're happy to help!
