The `JuliaBUGS` library in Julia supports parallel sampling through `AbstractMCMC`. While in a native Julia session this can be easily enabled by launching Julia with the `-t <n_threads>` flag, using multithreaded sampling via `rjuliabugs` requires additional setup. Specifically, you must define the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=n_threads`, where `n_threads` is the number of threads (or CPU cores) you wish to use for parallel computation. This ensures that `rjuliabugs` can properly initialize Julia with multithreading support when running multiple chains in parallel from within an R session. The instructions on how to configure `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` and enable multithreading in your environment, are the following: 

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
2. Check what is set as `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` is set by running:

```bash
echo $JULIA_NUM_THREADS
```

>(On Windows PowerShell use: `echo $Env:JULIA_NUM_THREADS`)

3. If empty or incorrectly set, decide how many threads you want Julia to use (e.g., 4), then set the environment variable in your terminal session:

```bash
export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4
```

> (On Windows PowerShell use: `$Env:JULIA_NUM_THREADS="4"`)

4. **To make this setting permanent (applies every time you open R and Julia):**

   - **On macOS/Linux:**  
     Open your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) with a text editor:  
     
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
     or 
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc  
     ```
     Add the following line at the end of the file:  
     ```bash
     export JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4  
     ```
     Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).  
     Then reload your shell configuration or restart your terminal:  
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```  
     *(or `source ~/.zshrc` if using zsh)*

   - **On Windows:**  
     1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and open "Edit the system environment variables."  
     2. Click "Environment Variables."  
     3. Under "User variables" or "System variables," click "New..."  
     4. Set the variable name as `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` and the value as the number of threads (e.g., `4`).  
     5. Click OK to save all dialogs.  
     6. Restart your terminal or R session for changes to take effect.

5. Verify it is set correctly by re-running:

```bash
echo $JULIA_NUM_THREADS  
```
> (or in R use: `Sys.getenv("JULIA_NUM_THREADS")`)

Setting `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` ensures Julia can execute in parallel where possible when running models through `rjuliabugs`.
